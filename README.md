IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Description
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their physical characteristics. The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in the field of data science and machine learning, containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Objective
Load and explore the Iris dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the datasetâ€™s structure and feature distributions.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, if any, and scaling features.
Build and train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize results and decision boundaries.
Interpret model findings and provide insights.

Key Highlights

Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy.
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Implementation of machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn.
Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
Clear and concise documentation for reproducibility.
